# Cancer Treatment Efficacy Analysis

This repository contains a Python code and data files for analyzing the efficacy of cancer treatment regimens in mice. The analysis investigates the impact of different treatments on tumor volume reduction, explores correlations between mouse characteristics and treatment outcomes, and visualizes key findings using various data visualization techniques.

## Contents

README.md: Overview of the analysis, including objectives, methodology, key findings, and recommendations.

data/: Directory containing Mouse Metadata and Study Results CSV files.

pymaceuticals_starter.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing Python code for data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualization.

output/: output files generated during the analysis, such as plots and summary statistics.

## Key Steps

Objective: Evaluate cancer treatment efficacy in mice.

Data Cleaning: Load, merge, and clean Mouse Metadata and Study Results data.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Calculate summary statistics of tumor volume for each treatment regimen.

Visualize treatment outcomes using various plots.

Key Findings:

Variations in treatment efficacy across drug regimens.
Positive correlation between mouse weight and tumor volume.
Influence of treatment duration on tumor growth dynamics.

## Usage

Clone repository: git clone < repository url>

Install dependencies: pandas, matplotlib

Open pymaceuticals_starter.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

Execute code cells for data analysis and visualization.

Review generated plots and summary statistics.
